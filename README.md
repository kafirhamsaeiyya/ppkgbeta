# ppkgbeta
A beta version of my package manager for the Bash shell, called Python Package.

## Information
This is currently a very early stage version of my package manager. It gathers information from the `neofetch.json` file to download the neofetch package and run it.
In time, I intend for this to be a full fledged package manager that fetches bash scripts for use onto a system.
## Testing
To test, just clone the repository and run the `.py` using `python3 ppkg.py`. As far as I know, this is Bash-exclusive, though I will try to expand to `dash` soon for Ubuntu.
